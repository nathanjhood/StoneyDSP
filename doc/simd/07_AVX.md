### **AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)**:
AVX was introduced by Intel in 2011 with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture. It significantly extended the capabilities of SSE by increasing the width of the SIMD registers and introducing new instructions for improved performance in various applications.

### **Key Features of AVX**:
- **256-bit AVX Registers**: AVX introduced sixteen new 256-bit YMM registers (`YMM0` to `YMM15`), effectively doubling the width of the SIMD registers compared to SSE.
- **Enhanced Floating-Point Operations**: AVX provided new instructions for floating-point arithmetic, supporting both single-precision and double-precision operations.
- **Three-Operand Syntax**: AVX introduced a three-operand syntax, allowing operations to have separate source and destination operands, reducing the need for additional move instructions.
- **Support for Non-Destructive Operations**: The three-operand syntax also supports non-destructive operations, preserving the original values in the source operands.
- **Alignment Agnostic**: AVX instructions can handle both aligned and unaligned memory accesses without significant performance penalties.

### **Example AVX Instructions**:
1. **`VADDPS`**: Add Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values
   - Adds corresponding single-precision floating-point values in two YMM registers.
2. **`VMULPD`**: Multiply Packed Double-Precision Floating-Point Values
   - Multiplies corresponding double-precision floating-point values in two YMM registers.
3. **`VBROADCASTSS`**: Broadcast Single-Precision Floating-Point Value
   - Broadcasts a single-precision floating-point value from memory to all elements of a YMM register.
4. **`VEXTRACTF128`**: Extract Packed Floating-Point Values
   - Extracts 128-bit floating-point values from a YMM register.

### **Example Usage**:
Here’s an example of using AVX to add two packed single-precision floating-point values:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void example_avx() {
    // Initialize two AVX registers with packed single-precision floating-point values
    __m256 avx_a = _mm256_set_ps(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f);
    __m256 avx_b = _mm256_set_ps(8.0f, 7.0f, 6.0f, 5.0f, 4.0f, 3.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f);

    // Add the packed single-precision floating-point values
    __m256 avx_result = _mm256_add_ps(avx_a, avx_b);

    // Store the result in an array
    float result_array[8];
    _mm256_storeu_ps(result_array, avx_result);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        printf("%f ", result_array[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    example_avx();
    return 0;
}
```

### **Use Cases**:
- **Scientific Computing**: AVX enhances the performance of scientific computations that involve heavy use of floating-point arithmetic, such as simulations and numerical analysis.
- **Graphics and Multimedia**: AVX is widely used in graphics and multimedia applications for tasks such as image processing, video encoding/decoding, and 3D rendering.
- **Signal Processing**: AVX improves the efficiency of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms by providing wider registers and new instructions for floating-point operations.

### **AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2)**:
AVX2, introduced by Intel in 2013 with the Haswell microarchitecture, built upon the foundation of AVX and added new instructions for integer operations and gather/scatter memory access patterns.

### **Key Features of AVX2**:
- **256-bit AVX2 Registers**: AVX2 uses the same 256-bit YMM registers as AVX (`YMM0` to `YMM15`).
- **Enhanced Integer Operations**: AVX2 introduced instructions for operating on packed integer data, providing efficient support for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers.
- **Gather Instructions**: AVX2 added gather instructions that allow for non-contiguous memory accesses, improving the performance of certain algorithms.
- **Fused Multiply-Add (FMA)**: AVX2 included FMA instructions that perform multiply-add operations in a single step, reducing latency and improving performance.

### **Example AVX2 Instructions**:
1. **`VPADDQ`**: Add Packed Quadword Integers
   - Adds corresponding 64-bit integers in two YMM registers.
2. **`VGATHERDPS`**: Gather Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values
   - Gathers single-precision floating-point values from non-contiguous memory locations.
3. **`VFMADD132PS`**: Fused Multiply-Add of Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values
   - Performs a fused multiply-add operation on packed single-precision floating-point values.

### **Example Usage**:
Here’s an example of using AVX2 to add two packed 64-bit integers:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void example_avx2() {
    // Initialize two AVX2 registers with packed 64-bit integers
    __m256i avx2_a = _mm256_set_epi64x(1, 2, 3, 4);
    __m256i avx2_b = _mm256_set_epi64x(4, 3, 2, 1);

    // Add the packed 64-bit integers
    __m256i avx2_result = _mm256_add_epi64(avx2_a, avx2_b);

    // Store the result in an array
    long long result_array[4];
    _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)result_array, avx2_result);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        printf("%lld ", result_array[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    example_avx2();
    return 0;
}
```
