| <p>Hi! I'm Nathan (aka <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP">StoneyDSP</a>).</p>  |
| :-: |
| <p>I am making audio plugins, and a custom C++ library.</p> |
| |
| <p>You may use this library to build your own audio software with on MIT license.</p> |
| |
| <p>We are still in the early days of construction, so please consider bookmarking and keeping on eye on development! </p> |
| |
| <p>This is something that I am working on during my free time, so progress may occasionally be sporadic; however, we already have a *lot* of plugins, instruments, and interesting DSP up and running behind the scenes, and even more in working prototypes and breadboards. There are also various other types of software and tooling currently under construction that will likely appeal to visitors of this project.</p> |
| |
| <p>In other words, plenty of reasons to stay tuned! </p> |
| |
| <p>Meanwhile, a small selection of older audio plugins are available as source code under permissive open-source licenses, much of which shall be re-contextualized to make use of the StoneyDSP audio and graphics libraries in due course, and may be found here:</p> |
