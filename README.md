## Quickstart

Clone StoneyDSP:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:StoneyDSP/StoeyDSP:git && cd StoneyDSP
```

Build with GNU Make:

```sh
$ make
```

Or build with CMake:

```sh
$ cmake -S . -B ./build
```

- ### Presets

  When building StoneyDSP from source, we provide an extensive set of curated CMake Presets for a simplified, streamlined workflow.

  CMake presets provide multiple possible actions - configure, build, test, package, and so forth - and also the ability to chain these actions together into a "workflow".

  For example, configuring the CMake project for 64-bit Linux platforms in "Release" mode with extra logging enabled is as easy as:

  ```sh
  $ cmake --preset x64-linux-release-verbose
  ```

  Our CMake Presets are specified as: `<arch>-<platform>-<mode>[-<option>]`

  Where `<arch>` may be any of:

  - `x86` (32-bit machines)
  - `x64` (64-bit machines)
  - `arm64` (ARM machines)

  Where `<platform>` may be any of:

  - `windows`
  - `osx`
  - `linux`

  Where `<mode>` may be any of:

  - `release`
  - `debug`

  Where `[-option]` may be unspecified, or any of:

  - `verbose`

  CMake, CTest, and CPack all respond appropriately to the various preset combinations available. The entire set of actions, demonstrated with the example preset as before, is as follows:

  CMake configure with a preset:

  ```sh
  $ cmake --preset x64-linux-release-verbose
  ```

  CMake re-configure with a preset:

  ```sh
  $ cmake --preset x64-linux-release-verbose --fresh
  ```

  CMake build with a prest:

  ```sh
  $ cmake --build ./build --preset x64-linux-release-verbose
  ```

  CTest test with a preset:

  ```sh
  $ ctest --test-dir ./build --preset x64-linux-release-verbose
  ```

  CMake package the build tree with a preset (calls CPack underneath):

  ```sh
  $ cmake --build ./build --preset x64-linux-release-verbose --target package
  ```

  CMake package the source tree with a preset (calls CPack underneath):

  ```sh
  $ cmake --build ./build --preset x64-linux-release-verbose --target package_source
  ```

  *NOTE:* Our presets all use Ninja as a generator to ensure cross-compatibility and reduce complexity.

  Not all platform and architecture combinations are currently supported; here is a summary of what we guarantee as of writing:

  ```txt
  // windows
  "x86-windows-debug"
  "x86-windows-release"
  "x86-windows-debug-verbose"
  "x86-windows-release-verbose"

  "x64-windows-debug"
  "x64-windows-release"
  "x64-windows-debug-verbose"
  "x64-windows-release-verbose"

  // osx
  "x86-osx-debug"
  "x86-osx-release"
  "x86-osx-debug-verbose"
  "x86-osx-release-verbose"

  "x64-osx-debug"
  "x64-osx-release"
  "x64-osx-debug-verbose"
  "x64-osx-release-verbose"

  "arm64-osx-debug"
  "arm64-osx-release"
  "arm64-osx-debug-verbose"
  "arm64-osx-release-verbose"

  // Linux
  "x86-linux-debug"
  "x86-linux-release"
  "x86-linux-debug-verbose"
  "x86-linux-release-verbose"

  "x64-linux-debug"
  "x64-linux-release"
  "x64-linux-debug-verbose"
  "x64-linux-release-verbose"
  ```

- ### Workflows

  StoneyDSP also provides workflows for all possible presets:

  ```sh
  $ cmake --preset x64-linux-release-verbose --workflow
  ```

  The workflows run the following steps in order:

  - configure
  - build
  - test
  - package build
  - package source

  To streamline this even further, we have implemented a platform look-up method in our Makefile, which automatically selects an appropriate preset for your host machine's platform and architecture, with additional options set as environment variables on the command line.

  In other words, if you are on a 64-bit Windows platform and just run:

  ```sh
  $ make workflow

  // x64-windows-release workflow is running...
  ```

  Our look-up mechanism will automatically select the `x64-windows-release` preset for you. This applies to all possible preset combinations on all platforms (not only 64-bit Windows).

  Additionally, if you wish to run the workflow - or any preset - in `Debug` mode - with the compiler generating debugger symbols, some helpful additional logging, and other expected "debugging" behaviours, just prepend `DEBUG=1` to the same command:

  ```sh
  $ DEBUG=1 make workflow

  // x64-windows-debug workflow is running...
  ```

  In addition to the standard `DEBUG` environment workflows and our presets respond similarly to `VERBOSE=1` for enabling gratuituous logging to the console by selecting a `-verbose` option from the presets list:

  ```sh
  $ VERBOSE=1 make workflow

  // x64-windows-release-verbose workflow is running...
  ```

  Of course, both flags can be combined to access the final variant:

  ```sh
  $ DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=1 make workflow

  // x64-windows-debug-verbose workflow is running...
  ```
